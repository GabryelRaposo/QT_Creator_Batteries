# Battery Charging and Discharging Data Analysis 
A serious problem in the construction of electronic devices is the correct selection of the power source. In these types of
devices, lithium-ion batteries are commonly used nowadays, and in particular their variety—lithium
iron phosphate battery—LiFePO4. In that perspective, this project was developed to analyse the Charging and Discharging Process of LiFePO4 Battery,
creating a GUI in QT CREATOR, which, by introducing a CSV file of the battery parameters allows the user to draw graphics and analyse them.
